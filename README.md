# Classification-UK-Smoker

Classification and characteristics of smoking in the UK can be explored using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data on smoking behaviors collected from various sources such as health surveys and demographic data, machine learning techniques can classify individuals into different categories based on their smoking habits. Machine learning models can learn patterns and trends in the data, including factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors that influence smoking behavior. Using classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines, models can identify the most significant features in distinguishing between smokers and non-smokers, as well as predict the likelihood of someone becoming a smoker based on these characteristics. The insights gained from this analysis can provide valuable insights for public health policies and prevention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking and its impact on public health in the UK.
